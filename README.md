## Overview

**Live version [here](https://frankysblogspace.netlify.app/)**

BlogSpace is a little app app, part of Module 8 of the Front-Developer Career Path over at [scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com).
With this app, we focused on getting data from the JSONPlaceHolderAPI service, and displaying 'article-style' elements on the screen.

We also allow users to create a post on BlogSpace, although the data is not really saved on the backend. We basically send a POST request to the JSONPlaceHolderAPI and get a response with the content of our original message back. And an ID. Which we are not really using ðŸ˜‚

Anyway! It's a very tiny project, I did not spend any time at all on the styling or anything. Well maybe a little styling here and there. But I wanted to focus on the technical side here.

APIs are really interesting, and I did work with them a lot already in my job as a Solution Architect, to interact with Esko's WebCenter Application.

It was nice to build something from the ground up and really understand how these APIs typically work.

Below are once more the topics we covered in this module:
